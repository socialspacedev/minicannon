This is a small web project I'm using to better understand the full potential of <a href="https://cloudcannon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudCannon</a>. It's built using the speedy <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty</a> static site generator (SSG) using an elegant <a href="https://github.com/MarcoMicale/Minimalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimalism</a> theme developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MarcoMicale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marco Micale</a>. I've customised a bunch of things behind the scenes already and plan to evolve this into a complete CloudCannon site optimised for visual editing.
