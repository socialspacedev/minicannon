# What's this?

This is a small web project I'm using to better understand the full potential of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com">CloudCannon</a>. It's built using the speedy <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator (SSG) using an elegant <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/MarcoMicale/Minimalism">minimalism</a> theme developed by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/MarcoMicale">Marco Micale</a>. I've customised a bunch of things behind the scenes already and plan to evolve this into a complete CloudCannon site optimised for content editing.

It may never be finished ðŸ˜¬.&nbsp;
