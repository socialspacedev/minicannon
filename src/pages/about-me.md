# About

I'm a pākeha based in Otepoti, New Zealand. I'm Head of Customer Experience at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com">CloudCannon</a>. A Parent. A Cat owner. An elderly footballer. Intermittent noise maker and collector of records. Formally, a business owner, academic, radio host, Tāmaki Makaurau citizen and other forgotten things.​​​​​<img width="100%" alt="An aged fellow concentrating on taking a selfie" title="It me." src="/img/me-sideon.PNG" />Hit the social media links in the footer for more 👇🏻

## Why Ānaru?

At my previous role we celebrated&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reomaori.co.nz/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2022">Te Wiki o te Reo Māori</a> every year. As part of this activity we took it a step further and referred to each other by the Māori translation of our names. I loved it so much and felt it a genuine honour to be called Ānaru everyday (Anndroo 😬) particularly by tangata whenua colleagues. As a result I sought permission to use Ānaru as a domain name so that I could communicate from the only motu this name exists – Aotearoa – and identify more strongly as pākeha.

## Noise

For something random here's a clip of&nbsp; the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/lifeanddeathbrigadenz">Life and Death Brigade</a>&nbsp;last year explaining a show we played at Zelle Fest, Port Chalmers in 2022.
