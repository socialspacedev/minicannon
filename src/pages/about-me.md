# About Me

I'm a pākeha based in Otepoti, New Zealand. I'm currently Head of Customer Experience at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com">CloudCannon</a>. A Parent. A Cat owner. Intermittent noise maker and collector of records. Formally, a business owner, academic, radio host, Tāmaki Makaurau citizen and other forgotten things.

## Why Ānaru?

At my previous role we celebrated&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reomaori.co.nz/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2022">Te Wiki o te Reo Māori</a> every year. As part of this activity we took it a step further and referred to each other by the Māori translation of our names. I loved it so much and felt it a genuine honour to be called Ānaru (which is so much better than Anndroo), particularly by tangata whenua colleagues.

As a result I sought permission to use Ānaru as a domain name so that I could communicate from the only place in the world this name exists – Aotearoa.

## Noise

Finally, here is a clip of&nbsp; the Life and Death Brigade where we attempted to talk about a show we played in 2022 at Zelle Fest, Port Chalmers.
