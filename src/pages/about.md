# About

I'm a pākeha based in Otepoti, New Zealand. I'm Head of Customer Experience at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com">CloudCannon</a>. A Parent. A Cat owner. An elderly footballer. Intermittent noise maker and collector of records. Formally, a business owner, academic, radio host, Tāmaki Makaurau citizen and other forgotten things.​​​​​<img width="2346" height="1795" src="/img/me-sideon.PNG" />Hit the social media links in the footer for more 👇🏻

## Why Ānaru?

At my previous role we celebrated <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reomaori.co.nz/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2022">Te Wiki o te Reo Māori</a> every year. As part of this activity we took it a step further and referred to each other by the Māori translation of our names. I loved it so much and felt it a genuine honour to be called Ānaru everyday (Anndroo 😬) particularly by my Māori colleagues. As a result I sought permission to use Ānaru as a domain name so that I could communicate from the only motu this name exists – Aotearoa – and identify more strongly as pākeha.

## Work

If you want to work or collaborate with me, here's how I roll:

* I like contributing, doing meaningful work and delivering value.
* I like being included and valued.
* I am ambitious about the mission, its people and my teams.
* I like being involved in different things using my versatile skills and experience.
* I like learning, solving problems and executing.
* I'm not a big fan of the orthodox or status quo (by nature).
* I can't help but care so heart-lead and often unflinchingly open.
