## Pepeha

Kia ora tātou

Ngā mihi au ki te maunga ō Maungakiekie

Ngā mihi au ki te moana o Hauraki

Ko Scotland te whenua ō ōku tīpuna

Ko Tāmaki Makaurau te whenua tupu

Kei Ōtepoti au e noho ana

He kaiwhakahaere au i CloudCannon

Ko Andrew tōku ingoa

Tēnā tātou katou

## Ko wai au?

I'm pākeha (tangata Tiriti) based in Otepoti, New Zealand. I'm Head of Customer Experience at <a href="https://cloudcannon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudCannon</a>. A Parent. A Cat owner. An elderly footballer. Intermittent noise maker and collector of records. Formally, a business owner, academic, radio host, Tāmaki Makaurau citizen and other forgotten things.

## Ānaru?

At my previous role we celebrated <a href="https://www.reomaori.co.nz/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Te Wiki o te Reo Māori</a> every year. As part of this activity we took it a step further and referred to each other by the Māori translation of our names. I loved it so much and felt it a genuine honour to be called Ānaru everyday (Anndroo 😬) particularly by my Māori colleagues. As a result I sought permission to use Ānaru as a domain name so that I could communicate from the only motu this name exists – Aotearoa – and identify more strongly as pākeha.
