## Pepeha

Kia ora tātou

Ngā mihi au ki te maunga ō Maungakiekie

Ngā mihi au ki te moana o Hauraki

Ko Kōtirana te whenua ō ōku tīpuna

Ko Tāmaki Makaurau te whenua tupu

Kei Ōtepoti au e noho ana

He kaiwhakahaere au i Get Home Safe

He tangata Tiriti ahau

Ko Andrew tōku ingoa

Tēnā tātou katou

## Ko wai au?

 I'm pākeha (tangata Tiriti) based in Otepoti, New Zealand. I'm currently General Manager at <a href="https://www.gethomesafe.com/" title="Keep you people safe with our platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Home Safe</a> and a parent, cat owner, elderly footballer, intermittent noise maker, collector of records and dietary challenged. Formally, a business owner, academic, radio host, Tāmaki Makaurau citizen and other forgotten things.

## Ānaru

At an earlier job we celebrated <a href="https://www.reomaori.co.nz/te-wiki-o-te-reo-maori-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Te Wiki o te Reo Māori</a> every year. As part of this activity we took it a step further by referring to each other by the Māori translation of our names. I loved this and felt it a genuine honour being called Ānaru everyday –particularly by my Māori colleagues. Consequently I sought permission to use Ānaru as a domain name to identify more strongly as pākeha/tangata Tiriti and support te reo in a public way.
