Grahame Naysmith the excellent guitarist for shoe-gazy band Pale Saints <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/pale-saints-guitarist-graeme-naysmith-dead-at-57/" title="Death announcement in Far Out Magazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died</a> a couple of days ago. Pale Saints were a 4AD band in the shoegazy/Indie/Alt camp with choirboy vocals, pummelling bass and scorching, textual guitar.

Their first album <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/pale-saints-comforts-of-madness-2645229979.html" title="Article on the album reissue and 30 year anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Comforts of Madness</a> is essential closely followed by <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/pale-saints/looking-back-30-years-to-the-creation-of-pale-saints-in-ribbons" title="Article looking at 30 years of In Ribbons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Ribbons</a>. Ian Masters left after the second album and that was pretty much it for the band.

"You Tear the World in two" is probably my favourite from The Comforts of Madness. But to be honest the whole thing is great and has interstitial noises between each track so no silence.
