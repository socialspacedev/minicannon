The following photos were taken from June to August this year on my trusty Olympus OM 1. There's a mix of locations including Dunedin, Auckland and Brisbane, and three different b&w films.

These are:

* Ilford Orthographic Plus (80)
* Ilford FP4 Plus (125)
* Kodak Tri-X (400)

Of the three, I had never used the Ilford ortho film before and was super curious to find out how it looks. This film renders anything coloured red as dark black and creates a contrasty, moody look (which I love!). Because it's very slow, the results are also very fine grained.

I also experimented with a new Tamron 70-200 F/2.8 lens which judging by the results, needs some maintenance. This lens was mostly used with the Tri-x and resulted in very grainy photos.
