The following photos were taken from June to August this year on my trusty Olympus OM 1. There's a mix of locations including Dunedin, Auckland and Brisbane, and three different b&w films.

These are:

* <a href="https://www.analog.cafe/r/ilford-fp4-plus-film-review-osps" title="Illford FP4 Plus review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilford FP4 Plus</a> (125)
* <a href="https://www.analog.cafe/r/kodak-tri-x-400-film-review-5pbm" title="Kodak Tri-X (400 TX) review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kodak Tri-X</a> (400)

Of the three, I had never used the Ilford ortho film before and was super curious to find out how it looks. This film renders anything coloured red as dark black and creates a contrasty, moody look (which I love!). Because it's very slow, the results are also very fine grained.

I also experimented with a new Tamron 70-200 F/2.8 lens which judging by the results, needs some maintenance. This lens was mostly used with the Tri-x and resulted in very grainy photos.
