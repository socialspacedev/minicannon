The following photos were taken from June-to-August this year on my trusty Olympus OM 1. There's a mix of locations including Dunedin, Auckland and Brisbane using three different b&w films.

{% image, "/img/three-films.jpg" "Three films and canisters" "30em 50vw 100vw" %}

These are:

* <a href="https://www.analog.cafe/r/kodak-tri-x-400-film-review-5pbm" title="Kodak Tri-X (400 TX) review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kodak Tri-X</a> (400)
* <a href="https://www.analog.cafe/r/ilford-ortho-plus-80-film-review-hz9m" title="Ilford Ortho Plus 80 review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilford Orthographic Plus</a> (80)
* <a href="https://www.analog.cafe/r/ilford-fp4-plus-film-review-osps" title="Illford FP4 Plus review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilford FP4 Plus</a> (125)

Of the three, I had never used the Ilford Ortho Plus film before and was super curious to find out how it looks. This film renders anything coloured red as dark black and creates a contrasty, moody look (which I love!). Because it's very slow, the results are also very fine grained.

I also experimented with a new Tamron 70-200 F/2.8 lens which judging by the results, needs some maintenance. This lens was mostly used with the Tri-x and resulted in very grainy photos with an occasional exposure flare.

*The following three photos were taken at the Brisbane Botanic gardens using the Ortho Plus. I think they are the most successful in terms of sharpness and contrast.*

*This is my almost 90 year old father-in-law on a day trip out to Muriwai looking for gannets (there weren't any). This was taken using FP4 Plus.*

*These two city scapes are from the excellent Brisbane Cultural Precinct overlooking the river. Both these are Ortho Plus.*

*Finally, a couple of local sporting action shots. The first, uses Tri-X and the zoom lens to capture my daughter playing her hockey final. The second, is masters football at its finest at Ocean Grove using the FP4 Plus.*

{% image, "/img/long012-long012-r1-e032.jpg" "Old man football at Ocean Grove" "30em 50vw 100vw" %}

Of of the three emulsions, I love the dark 'n' moody impact of Ortho Plus. More experiments to come!
