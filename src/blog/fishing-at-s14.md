Over the weekend we picked up a new 8ft fishing rod and a few 40g twist lures of differing colours. This was principally to practice casting into the surf and perhaps catch a Kahawai to smoke (if we're lucky).

We headed to various spots along the Kakanui coast. First Kakanui beach then All-day Bay then back up to <a href="https://waitakinz.com/14s-beach/" title="Read more about this mysterious beach." target="_blank" rel="noopener">14S beach</a> near Bones Lodge. The latter (seamingly nameless beach) was the pick of the spots with a few other punters trying their luck.

Other than catching my shorts there were no fish to be seen. This didn't matter at all as my casting improved, I got wet and we spent time at a delightful beach getting our calves burned.
