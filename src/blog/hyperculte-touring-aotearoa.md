The Geneva based "sonic adventurers" <a href="https://hyperculte.bandcamp.com/" title="Hyperculte's Bandcamp page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperculte</a> are <a href="https://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/21260/Hyperculte-Switzerland-Touring-New-Zealand-In-March--April.utr" title="Tour details are Under the Radar." target="_blank" rel="noopener">touring</a> Aotearoa in March and April. The duo of Simone Aubert and Vincent Bertholet bring their unique experimental krautrock for an extensive trip around primarily smaller towns across the country.

Here they are performing live at the <a href="https://www.noxorae.ch/le-festival" title="Website for the Nox Orae festival in Geneva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nox Orae</a> festival in 2019:

I'm looking to attend their show at Yours with support from Sewage on Wednesday April 3rd. <a href="https://cmr-sewage.bandcamp.com/album/sewage" title="Sewage's Bandcamp page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sewage</a> are a highly regarded local duo who deliver an avant-jazz flavoured improvisational experience with drums, violin, saxophone, and more!

For a wee taste, check our the following performance at Christchurch student radio RDU:

For more information on the Hyperculte tour, here's the official press release:

> Pyramid Club is happy to present HYPERCULTE (Switzerland) NZ TOUR 2024!
>
> In March 2020 Hyperculte landed in NZ just as Covid hit. Three gigs into their 14-date tour they had to abandon the mission and fly home before lockdowns began. Four years later they're back to finish what they started! Avant-garde jazz-punk? Pre-kraut post-disco? Minimalist trance pop?
>
> Hyperculte's music hints at the kind of ancient, pine-scented black magic of central European folklore captured in the costumes on the cover of their 2016 self titled debut album. Driving forces of the Geneva experimental rock scene, Simone Aubert (drums/guitar/vocals) and Vincent Bertholet (double bass/vocals) hail from the either side of the mountainous, myth-drenched Swiss-French border region.
>
> They met when living in the same squat in Geneva and started playing together in 2014. Simone came from the dark and experimental band Massicot, Vincent from the Dadaist big band Orchestra Tout Puissant Marcel Duchamp.
