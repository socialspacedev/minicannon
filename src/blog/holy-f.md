The great genre-bending electronic machines band <a href="https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/" title="Homepage for Holy Fuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holy Fuck</a> played a New Zealand tour the other week. I was lucky to see their epic <a href="https://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/21097/Holy-Fuck-Touring-New-Zealand-In-February.utr" title="Click to read about their NZ tour." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auckland show</a> at the MotherShip as shown in the blurry photo above.

They were mind-blowingly excellent and despite feeling bloated on fine dining beforehand, we couldn't help but groove a bit. Most of the audience were as ancient as us and criminally under-numbered. They were superb.
