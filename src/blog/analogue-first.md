I'm currently obsessed with my Olympus OM 1 with a Zuiko 50mm lens. I've been experimenting with a variety of black and white emulsions such as Kodak Tri-X, Ilford XP2, FP4 Plus, etc. I'm still a novice but enjoying the time it takes to capture a single photo with no idea how it will turn out.

You can find a few of these experiments on my <a href="https://pixelfed.nz/i/portfolio/andrew" title="Opens Pixelfed portfolio." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixelfed portfolio</a> but here's a selection below. Most of these are taken over Christmas 2024 using Kodak Tri-X.
