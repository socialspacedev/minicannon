This is a post about Monster Truck. He was my cat companion for over 14 years until we had to euthanise him today due to an aggressive mouth cancer.

Monst was a magnificent, strongly marked, and large Maine Coon. He was a polydactyl with enormous paws, even as a kitten, so his name presented itself. Absolutely nothing to do with his temperament as he was very gentle and bit of a scaredy cat (unless you were a rodent).
