This is a post about **Monster Truck** who was my sweet cat companion for over 14 and half years. Sadly, we had to make the call to euthanise him due to an aggressive mouth cancer. It was only diagnosed the previous month and we are bereft.

Monst was a magnificent, strongly marked, and large Maine Coon. He was a polydactyl with enormous paws, even as a kitten, so his name presented itself. Absolutely nothing to do with his temperament as he was very gentle and quite the scaredy cat (unless you were a rodent!). Despite his large size, he was definitely not a fighter and would prefer to make friends with other cats if he could.

One of his best mates was Boo who lived next door. They spent many hours on the footpath outside the front of our house hanging out like old lawn bowlers. Sadly Boo was euthanised recently too at the ripe old age of 20.

He was pedigree from the Dunedin breeding cattery <a href="https://shiningwater.me/" title="ShiningWater homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiningWater</a>.  His markings and large jaw took after his even larger father Finn – who might still be on the front page of the breeder website.

Monst slept most of his years leaning hard on my feet and he was heavy! He demonstrated a variety of chirrups, trills and meows to communicate what he wanted, and while not the smartest cat in the world, he was the loveliest and enjoyed big hugs every night (which I miss enormously). Luckily he was also incredibly healthy over his life and barely visited the vet until recently.

Fortunately we have many photos to remember him by and here are some of them.
