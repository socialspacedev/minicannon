Jerome Bruner died this week aged 100. He was an elegant writer with an insatiable curiosity and intellectual openness. His thinking influenced (even shaped) cognitive psychology, education, law, narrative theory and more.

Check out his obituary in the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F06%2F09%2Fscience%2Fjerome-s-bruner-who-shaped-understanding-of-the-young-mind-dies-at-100.html&amp;t=ZGFjNzMxYmFjNWFhNmMzNGE1NDdlNWU1YTc2MTczZTY0MTFkYTM5MCxOZ2pTd0VXaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A8D2vEEs4SpsMxLlNQ4JZIQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.anaru.nz%2Fpost%2F145689055594%2Fjerome-bruner-said-hi&amp;m=1&amp;ts=1679189714">New York Times</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://href.li/?https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jerome-s-bruner-influential-psychologist-of-perception-dies-at-100/2016/06/07/033e5870-2cc3-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html">Washington Post</a>&nbsp;as well as this piece at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://href.li/?http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/06/an-unfinished-quest-in-education/486074/">The Atlantic</a>&nbsp;to get a better idea.

I was introduced to his writings on narrative and cognition while working on a now abandoned thesis. In particular, I really liked his book&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FActs-Meaning-Lectures-Culture-Jerusalem-Harvard%2Fdp%2F0674003616&amp;t=OWYzNmRhNTBkZWI2ZmRiY2RkZWYzNjM2NWY3MDAzZjE4MTE2MzQyYixOZ2pTd0VXaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A8D2vEEs4SpsMxLlNQ4JZIQ&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.anaru.nz%2Fpost%2F145689055594%2Fjerome-bruner-said-hi&amp;m=1&amp;ts=1679189714">Acts of Meaning</a>&nbsp;and an essay called “<a target="_blank" href="https://href.li/?http://nil.cs.uno.edu/publications/papers/bruner1991narrative.pdf">The Narrative Construction of Reality</a>”.

At the time (2007 onwards) I was looking at how narratives presented in Twitter and if they could be used to pull together related conversation threads. Mostly I was excited about Twitter as an autobiographical machine.

Anyway, in 2009 I saw that Bruner was still on the faculty at NYU. On a whim, I sent him an email with a splurge of poorly formed ideas based around his writing.&nbsp;

On the very same night, he replied back to me (he was in his 90s at this point!) with the following kind words:

I printed this out and stuck it on my office wall for inspiration. Sadly it wasn’t quite enough to get me there.

Next time!
