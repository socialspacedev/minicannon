I'm currently obsessed with my [Olympus OM 1](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDL4IWUJ11G/ "Takes you to my Instagram post showing the camera") with a Zuiko 50mm lens. I've been experimenting with a variety of black and white emulsions such as Kodak Tri-X, Ilford XP2, FP4 Plus, etc. I'm still a novice but enjoying the time it takes to capture a single photo with no idea how it'll turn out.

You can find a few of these experiments on my [Pixelfed portfolio](https://pixelfed.nz/i/portfolio/andrew "Opens Pixelfed portfolio"). In the meantime here's a selection taken over Christmas 2024 using Kodak Tri-X.
