<a href="https://www.harmonicstudio.com/" title="Peter Hobbs' sound studio in Auckland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Hobbs</a> is a former Dunedin musician from amazing bands like <a href="https://peterhobbs.bandcamp.com/album/testpot" title="Kitset's one and an only album at Bandcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kitset</a> who now makes soundtracks, ads, sound installations and other field recording-based experiments. <a href="https://peterhobbs.bandcamp.com/album/bee-sides" title="Bandcamp link to the Bee Sides album" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bee Sides</a> is his latest magnificent release celebrating and featuring bees doing their thing.

He says this about it:

> To honour the beloved bees I have composed an album entirely from the sounds of bees and their environments - all instruments were made from field recordings of bees in my local Waitakere Ranges forest. The tracks follow the bees journey from the dawn hive to the Rewarewa, following the river to the Manuka, and back to the hive at dusk.

Bee Sides is gentle and beautiful and I recommend listening to the whole thing when you need something contemplative to quiet a noisy mind.
