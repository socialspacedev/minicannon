Kurt Cobain of Nirvana <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1994/04/09/721212.html?pageNumber=1" title="Original Kurt Cobain obituary from the NY Times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died</a> 30 years ago today.

Michael Azerrad wrote a really insightful <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/my-time-with-kurt-cobain" title="Michael Azerrad's article on Kurt Cobain at the New Yorker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> for the New Yorker a few years ago which probably does the best job explaining the before and after. Azerrad also wrote an essential book called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life" title="Our Band could be your life Wikipedia article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a>: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991" which covers the formation of bands such as Hüsker Dü , Sonic youth, Mission of Burma, Fugazi, and so on.

Many of these bands were key to the formation of Cobain's sound and approach too.
