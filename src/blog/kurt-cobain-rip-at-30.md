Kurt Cobain of Nirvana <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1994/04/09/721212.html?pageNumber=1" title="Original Kurt Cobain obituary from the NY Times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died</a> 30 years ago today. At the time this was of huge significance, particularly as he was the unwitting figurehead for alternative/indie music bludgeoning its way into the mainstream.

I was lucky enough to see them live at their one and only <a href="https://www.livenirvana.com/concerts/92/92-02-09.php" title="Live details for the 1992 Auckland Nirvana gig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand gig</a> in 1992. Kurt was clearly not doing well and they played a perfunctionary set. The 3Ds were easily the band of the night and Second Child were great also. Nevertheless, I recall enjoying it and was particularly happy they played Lounge Act from Nevermind.

Check out the prices of international gigs 30 years ago! Even cooler I got two free tickets care of my first proper boss. I recall them stuck to the whiteboard in the computer room in which I was trapped inside for a job (kinda like below).

While never a huge fan, Cobain and Nirvana were a cultural phenomenon and hard to ignore. This is evidenced by events such as the In Utero release party at Bob's bar in High Street, Auckland. This was I think an exclusive event where attendees got to hear the album from start to finish before it was released.

Weird concept and the only one of these I've ever attended.

Weirder I was asked to cover a DJ slot on Saturday (April 9th) afternoon by Graeme Hill at <a href="https://95bfm.com/" title="Website for 95 bFM radiostation in Auckland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bFM</a>. I had seem him at a gig (some band with shoes in their name I think) the night before where both of us were quite drunk. Part of my duties that afternoon was announcing the death and updating listeners with any breaking changes.

My next encounter with Nirvana is enjoying my son's obsession with the band and Kurt as a young boy.

Finally, I recommend reading Michael Azerrad's really insightful <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/my-time-with-kurt-cobain" title="Michael Azerrad's article on Kurt Cobain at the New Yorker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> for the New Yorker a few years ago. It does the best job explaining the before and after with a untainted personal connection.

Azerrad also wrote an essential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life" title="Wikipedia page detailing the book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> called "Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991" which covers the formation of bands such as Hüsker Dü , Sonic youth, Mission of Burma, Fugazi, and so on. Many of these bands were pretty clear inspiration for Nirvana.
