Kurt Cobain of Nirvana <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1994/04/09/721212.html?pageNumber=1" title="Original Kurt Cobain obituary from the NY Times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died</a> 30 years ago today. At the time this was of huge significance, particularly as he was the unwitting figurehead for alternative/indie music bludgeoning its way into the mainstream.

I was lucky enough to see them live at their one and only <a href="https://www.livenirvana.com/concerts/92/92-02-09.php" title="Live details for the 1992 Auckland Nirvana gig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand gig</a> in 1992. Kurt was clearly not doing well and they played a perfunctionary set –&nbsp;with the 3Ds as the band of the night. I recall enjoying it though and was particularly happy they played Lounge Act from Nevermind.

Even cooler I got free tickets from my first boss. I recall them stuck to the whiteboard in the computer room I was trapped in for a job.

While never a huge fan, Cobain and Nirvana were a cultural phenomenon and hard to ignore. This is evidenced by events such as the In Utero release party at Bob's bar in High Street, Auckland. This was I think an exclusive event where attendees got to hear the album from start to finish before it was released.

Weird concept and the only one of these I've ever attended.

Weirder I was asked to cover a DJ slot on Saturday (April 9th) afternoon by Graeme Hill at bFM. I had seem him at a Shoes this High gig the night before where both of us were quite drunk. Nevertheless part of my duties that afternoon was announcing the death and updating listeners with any updates.

Michael Azerrad wrote a really insightful <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/my-time-with-kurt-cobain" title="Michael Azerrad's article on Kurt Cobain at the New Yorker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> for the New Yorker a few years ago which probably does the best job explaining the before and after. Azerrad also wrote an essential book called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life" title="Our Band could be your life Wikipedia article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a>: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991" which covers the formation of bands such as Hüsker Dü , Sonic youth, Mission of Burma, Fugazi, and so on.

Many of these bands were key to the formation of Cobain's sound and approach too.
