Kurt Cobain of Nirvana <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1994/04/09/721212.html?pageNumber=1" title="Original Kurt Cobain obituary from the NY Times" target="_blank" rel="noopener">died</a> 30 years ago today. At the time it was hugely significant as he was the unwitting figurehead for alternative/indie music bludgeoning its way into the mainstream. Top of the grunge heap.

I was lucky enough to see them live at their one and only <a href="https://www.livenirvana.com/concerts/92/92-02-09.php" title="Live details for the 1992 Auckland Nirvana gig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand gig</a> in 1992 (check out the prices of international gigs 30 years ago!). Even cooler I got two free tickets care of my first proper boss. I recall them stuck to the whiteboard in the computer room where I was trapped inside kinda like this:

Kurt was clearly not doing well and they played a perfunctionary set. The 3Ds were easily the band of the night and Second Child were great also. Nevertheless, I recall enjoying it and was particularly happy they played "Lounge Act". Here's a terrible sounding bootleg that gives an impression of being there.

While never a huge fan, Cobain and Nirvana were a cultural phenomenon and hard to ignore. This is evidenced by events such as the In Utero release party at Bob's bar in High Street, Auckland. This was I think an exclusive event where attendees got to hear the album from start to finish before it was released.

Weird concept and the only one of these I ever attended.

Weirder I was asked to cover a DJ slot at <a href="https://95bfm.com/" title="Website for 95 bFM radiostation in Auckland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bFM</a>. on Saturday April 9th (Cobain's body was found on the 8th US time) afternoon by Graeme Hill. I had coincidentally seen him at a Lure of Shoe gig the night before where both of us were pretty drunk. Part of my duties that afternoon was announcing the death and updating listeners with any breaking changes.

Then nothing for years until my next encounter with the band this century. My son developed a healthy obsession with the band and Kurt when he was very young. This inspired him to play guitar (see an early birthday gift below) and announce his future job as a rock star. He's since progressed to wider music interests outside punk rock including [making noise](/blog/the-life-and-death-brigade.html "The boys play a show") with his old man.

Michael Azerrad wrote a really insightful <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/my-time-with-kurt-cobain" title="Michael Azerrad's article on Kurt Cobain at the New Yorker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> about Cobain's death for the New Yorker  in 2021. It does the best job explaining the before and after with an untainted personal connection. I highly recommend wading through it (it's long!).

He also wrote a must have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life" title="Wikipedia page detailing the book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> called *"Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991"* . This excellent book covers the formation of bands such as Hüsker Dü , Sonic youth, Mission of Burma, Fugazi, and more.

Many of these bands were clear inspiration for Nirvana and to be honest, were better.
