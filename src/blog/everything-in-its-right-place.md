I heard this lovely tune on one of Colin Newman and Malka Spigal's recent <a href="https://www.totallyradio.com/shows/swimming-in-sound" title="Swimming in Sound" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radio shows</a>. It reminded me a little of the main riff of Radiohead's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_Gg1xAHE4" title="Video of the Pyramid Song by Radiohead." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pyramid Song</a>.

I'm no fan of Radiohead but do like the weird timing and melancholy arrangement of Pyramid Song (before the singing comes in that is ðŸ˜¬). Kaamal William's tune is a beautiful, mellow jazz instrumental with a warm, fat keyboard at the centre.
