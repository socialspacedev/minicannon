Before January 2022 I had never read a [Jack Reacher]() novel. I had seen the films featuring Tom Cruise as the titular character and series 1 of the much better [TV show](). On the back of reading just one book, I set myself the arbitrary goal of reading the remaining books back-to-back.

At that point there were 26 in the series with the <a href="https://www.penguin.co.nz/books/the-secret-9780552177566" title="The Secret by Lee and Andrew Child" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28th</a> published a few months ago. *Make Me* (care of a Hospice book shop) kicked things off, with*Tripwire* finishing the journey. Turns out I'm a slow reader so it ended up taking two years.

I read them out of order as determined by availability at second hand shops or failing that, bought new. I read a couple on Kindle concurrently and eventually nabbed the paperbacks to complete the set (see my bookshelf photo above).

The series was a consistently solid read despite the annual release schedule and the well established formula. The worst book by far was *Echo Burning* and for the top 5 we have (in no particular order):

* *Tripwire*
* *Personal*
* *Night School*
* *Make me*
* *Bad Luck and Trouble*

There are many best of lists but no-one will agree on a definitive ranking. This <a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/books/25-11-2022/all-28-of-lee-childs-jack-reacher-novels-ranked-from-worst-to-best" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinoff article</a> is a nice place to start though.
