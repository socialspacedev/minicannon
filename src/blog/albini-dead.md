On May 7th, 2024 he suffered a fatal heart attack doing what I presumed he loved. Working hard in his studio <a href="https://www.electricalaudio.com/" title="Website for Electrical Audio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electrical Audio</a> to capture the most authentic performance from a band as efficiently as possible.

A lot has been written about him, particularly over past couple of days and he's certainly said a lot himself over the decades.
