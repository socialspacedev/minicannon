For 40 years I’ve been trying to track down this book. I couldn’t remember the title or author but recalled some of the plot (incorrectly as it turns out!) and colour.

I read it during my first week of high school which is an intense time. I vaguely recall grabbing it off a rotating tower while on the library tour. I then forgot about it for years but at some point in my 20s, I became obsessed with tracking it down. No idea why but I ended up spending hours in shops like the Hard to Find bookshop scanning the sci-fi section, libraries, asking questions, and later searching online.

Got absolutely nowhere … until today!

On a whim, I asked my new AI mate Claude (sonnet 4.5 is great!) if it could try to identify this book I had been futilely looking for. After a fair amount back and forth, with some great memory prompting questions from Claude, it said this:

This was a huge relief as I had started to think I’d imagined the whole thing. The book is obscure and could well be terrible but nevertheless, I’ll locate a copy to put this mystery to rest once and for all. Of course this is utterly trivial in the scheme of things but the consistent nagging search in the back of my brain is over!

**Postscript**: After searching online and almost buying a copy from eBay, I thought I'd better try the local secondhand bookshop – <a href="https://www.hardtofind.co.nz/" title="Legendary Hard to Find but worth the effort bookshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hard to Find Second Hand Bookshop</a>.
